# Image Classification using TensorFlow and Keras

## Description
A set of flower photos provided by TensorFlow as an example. TensorFlow often includes example datasets for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Dataset
Dataset contains of 3,670 total images. The images are divided into five classes: Sunflower, Tulips, Roses, Dandelions, Daisy with approximately 700 images for each.

The image_batch represents a tensor with a size of (32, 180, 180, 3). It contains 32 images, each measuring 180x180 pixels with three color channels (Red, Green, Blue).

## Model
The Keras Sequential model is composed of three sets of convolution blocks (`tf.keras.layers.Conv2D`), each followed by a max pooling layer (`tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D`). Additionally, there is a fully-connected layer (`tf.keras.layers.Dense`) with 128 units at the top, which is activated using the ReLU activation function (`'relu'`). It's important to note that this model hasn't been fine-tuned for achieving the highest accuracy. 

### To Compile the model
For this model, we choose the `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam` optimizer and `tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` loss function. 

We aaply **data augmentation** using the following Keras preprocessing layers: `tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip`, `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation`, and `tf.keras.layers.RandomZoom`.

## Notes
### Using packages
- Keras (`tensorflow.python.keras`) for building models

- OpenCV (`cv2`) for processing images

- sikit-learn (`sklearn`) for train_test_split
